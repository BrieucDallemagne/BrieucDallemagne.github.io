# My options:
applied mathematics and Computer Engineering

# Here is a ranking of my favourite programming languages because my opinion is better than yours
1) Python   
- it's easy   
- first language i learned   
- best language for processing data   
2) Bash   
- it's fun   
- your terminal is the best friend you'll ever have   
3) Makefile    
- because java,C and OZ can't be in my top 3   
4) Java   
- Java > C   
5) C   
- worst regular programming language that i learned   
- in fact not bad but i still see segfault in my dreams   
6) OZ   
- trauma is still present
